# Client scripts

These scripts are executed when wekatester is used with `--workload client`

These are intended to be run *before* mounting a filesystem and joining the cluster.

Use the `ta` scripts to debug after joining a cluster.

Run this as such:
    `./wekatester -w client <weka server ip/name>`
